This is my study project to learn graphics programming. I'm trying to clone
enough of Minecraft to work through the basics.

Lots of inspiration is drawn by Shamus Young's [Frontier
project](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=11874) and Michael
Goodfellow's [SeaOfMemes](http://www.sea-of-memes.com). Some code is borrowed to
fill in gaps as I'm learning new concepts, but I intend to code it all up myself
eventually.

Currently it's running on Linux and Windows. I ditched support for OSX after
I realized that everything I was learning was actually deprecated a decade ago.
I'm aiming for OpenGL 3+ and I don't really want to bother with keeping older
versions in synch. Not at this point.
