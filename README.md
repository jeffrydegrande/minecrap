This is my study project to learn graphics programming. I'm trying to clone
enough of Minecraft to work through the basics.

Lots of inspiration is drawn (and some code borrowed) from Shamus Young's [Frontier
project](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=11874) and Michael
Goodfellow's [SeaOfMemes](http://www.sea-of-memes.com). 

Currently it runs on Linux and Windows only.
